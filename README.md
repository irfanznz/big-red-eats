# Big Red Eats

Hi there! Big Red Eats is essentially a clone of [Cornell AppDev's](https://www.cornellappdev.com/apps) Eatery App, except that BRE is written entirely in Dart utilizing the Flutter SDK for cross-platform development. I'm working on this project primarily as a means of improving my programming skills. I started this project over the summer to consolidate all my app development skills into one project, however, as I pick up better software engineering practices, I realize that this project has a lot of flaws in it. I plan on refactoring a lot of stuff in the future as I learn better programming solutions from my classes and elsewhere.
