# Big Red Eats

Hi there! Big Red Eats is essentially a clone of [Cornell AppDev's](https://www.cornellappdev.com/apps) Eatery App, except that BRE is written entirely in Dart utilizing the Flutter SDK for cross-platform development. I'm working on this project primarily as a means of improving my programming skills, so I don't believe you'll find intelligently-written code in it. There is no documentation. Yeah.
